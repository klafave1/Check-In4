## Check-In4 

##### 1. what youâ€™d hoped to accomplish for this week (i.e., a recap of your goals from the  previous week and your initial proposal) 
###### This week, my main focus was centered around testing the calendar functionality for user-friendliness. I also aimed to focus on refining the display aspect of the app.

##### 2. what you did accomplish for this week, including an assessment of what went faster or  slower than you thought it would 
###### I decided to shift my focus away from the display and instead concentrated entirely on the functionality of the app. I dedicated this week to ensuring that all features worked and also introduced new options (ability to select specific days for particular medications). Overall, progress was pretty steady, with nothing faster or slower than expected.

##### 3. what you hope to accomplish for next week
###### Moving forward, my aim is to continue refining and testing the app. I also intend to dedicate more time to enhancing the cosmetic aspects and overall display of the app.
